MNIST handwritten numbers classifier.

Inputs are .root files in the format created by the 'idx2root' program.

This is an skeleton approach. The network layout and the different training phases
and parameters are easily adjustable.

I do not provide any testing method, but just a simple ROOT script which randomly
loads images from the test and returns the response of the network. It is necessary
to modify the script with the paths of the testing image datasets.
